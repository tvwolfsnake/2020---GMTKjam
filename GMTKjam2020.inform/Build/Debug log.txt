Problem PM_NameWithText issued from inform7/Chapter 15/The Creator.w, line 567
(Assertion error: looking for alternative verbs in <the description of the clutch is "You don't know who this clutch belongs to. It is soft velvet with pearl adornment on the handle" the sweater is a stealable in the sitting room>.)

In Part I - Get Upstairs:


  >--> You wrote 'The description of the clutch is "You don't know who this
    clutch bel [...] with pearl adornment on the handle" The sweater is a
    stealable in the Sitting Room' (source text, line 167): but this seems to
    give something a name which contains double-quoted text, which is not
    allowed. If you do need quotes in a name, one option would be to write
    something like 'In the Saloon is 'Black' Jacques Bernoulli.'; but this
    problem message is often caused by an accident in punctuation, in which
    case you never intended to create an object - you thought that the text
    ended a sentence because it finished with sentence-ending punctuation, when
    in fact it didn't, so that I read the next words as following on. (It may
    help to know that I am reading the primary verb here as 'is', not 'is'.)

Problem PM_NameWithText issued from inform7/Chapter 15/The Creator.w, line 567
(Assertion error: looking for alternative verbs in <the description of the empty china plate is "The last surviving remnant of Clifton's favourite china set.  Very recently full of hors d'oeuvres. Currently littered with the debris of said hors d'oeuvres" the golden watch is a stealable in the sitting room>.)

  >--> You wrote 'The description of the empty china plate is "The last
    surviving remnant of Clif [...] the debris of said hors d'oeuvres" The
    golden watch is a stealable in the Sitting Room' (source text, line 171):
    again, this seems to give something a name which contains double-quoted
    text.
