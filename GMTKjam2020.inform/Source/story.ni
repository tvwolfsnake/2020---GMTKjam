[BASIC RULES]

Kleptomode is a truth state that varies.

When play begins:
	now kleptomode is false;
	say "This is some text before the title. Many games use this space to set the basic scene, get an insight into the player character's mental state. We could use this space to express how the player character feels about the situation, as they park their car, calm themself down, walk inside, and pinch that one character's wallet, and then follow it up with the title.";
	wait for any key.	

A stealable is a kind of undescribed thing.

A mourner is a kind of person.

A first-floor room is a kind of room.

Definition: a stealable is unheld if it is not carried.

The steal list is a list of objects that varies.

The most-recently-taken list is a list of objects that varies.
Carry out taking something (called the item):
	truncate the most-recently-taken list to the last 0 entries;
	add the item to the most-recently-taken list.

Every turn:
	let L be the steal list;
	now L is the list of visible unheld stealables;
	if the remainder after dividing the turn count by 7 is zero:
		if L is non-empty:
			now kleptomode is true;
			try silently taking a random visible unheld stealable;
			say "> take [most-recently-taken list][line break]You stuff it in your pocket as surreptitiously as you can.";
			now kleptomode is false;
			if a mourner is touchable:
				wait for any key;
				say "[line break]You just can't help yourself, can you.[line break][line break]";
				wait for any key;
				say "[quotation mark]THIEF! THIEF![quotation mark]";
				wait for any key;
				clear screen;
				now the left hand status line is "The Curb";
				end the story saying "You have been thrown out";
		if L is empty:
			say "Your fingers itch.";
			if a mourner is touchable:
				say "[line break]You feel eyes on you."

The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules. 
				
Instead of putting, inserting, or dropping a stealable, say "It might not be a good idea to give grieving rich people concrete evidence that you're stealing from them."

Check giving a stealable to a person:
	if the person is a mourner:
		say "It might not be a good idea to give grieving rich people concrete evidence that you're stealing from them.[first time][line break]Even rich people who [italic type]aren't[roman type] grieving tend to be extra-vindictive about that sort of thing.[only]" instead.

Instead of giving the wallet to a person:
	if the person is a mourner:
		say "The family is already watching you like a hawk, if you give it to one of them they'll probably think you stole it.[line break][line break]";
		wait for any key;
		say "Which, to be fair, you did.".
			
Instead of giving the wallet to Cartwright:
	say "That would be a really, really, really bad idea. I don't think he'll believe you if you claim you [quotation mark]just found it.[quotation mark][line break]If you really want to return it, you might want to find someone more sympathetic to your condition.".
	

Check taking a stealable:
	if kleptomode is false:
		[if the player is in Hors D'oeuvres Table...]
		say "This is a funeral reception and everyone knows you're a kleptomaniac. You're not going to intentionally take anything you aren't supposed to.[line break]" instead.

Instead of taking scenery, say "Against your will, you've gotten pretty good at taking things unnoticed. This, however, would attract attention, no matter how sneaky you are."

You think he's Uncle Clifton's brother? Maybe his cousin. Either way, his stature and his demeanor have the effect of making him intimidating, an effect which is only slightly diminished by your vague recollection that he is mildly allergic to a [italic type]comical[roman type] amount of things.[line break][line break][only]He seems annoyed with you.

Part III - Now Go Back Downstairs















Part IV - Spaghetti Code
		


[EVENTS]


[NOTES]

[okay so basically I need a list in each room with every stealable item on it (except the hors d'oeuvres), and code that checks if the list is non-empty.

if it is, it silently takes the first item from the list, removes it from the list, checks the bottom of a log of most recently taken items, and then says "> take [that item]".

THEN if there's a mourner in the room, wait for any key, do some extra text, "end the story saying [thing]".

the hors d'oeuvres will be a hundredfold item under standard take rules and no mourners will ever enter the area. this is unrealistic but I don't care. (can describe the table as kind of picked-over, and the mourners are busy talking.) theoretically this could lead to a situation where there are 0 hors d'oeuvres; if there's time I'll make that a fail state.

one problem with this approach is that the room descriptions will have to be dynamic in order to account for random item theft. hopefully it's possible to list every item on a table in a description, but if not (or if there's no time) we'll stick with the bad default "You can see x here."]


["After about a seven count, you]

[let K be the list of visible unheld scenery??? (thinking about taking a thing that's nailed down)]

[list of visible unheld stealables in the location]

[Instead of giving the peanut butter canapÃ© to Cartwright, say "You give Cartwright[unicode 2014]a man whose allergies might be way more severe than you're aware of[unicode 2014]a common and potentially life-threatening allergen.[line break][line break]";
wait for any key;
clear screen;
say "No. You don't. Obviously you don't.[line break][line break]";
wait for any key;
say "What is wrong with you?";
wait for any key;
clear screen.

Another option when he has the gun on you: Don't bring a canapÃ© to a gunfight.]

[Instead of attacking Cartwright:]

[He wasn't a good man [description of real estate holdings, slumlord, etc.] but for some reason he was kind to you.]

[later: put lawn in scope of sitting room and vice versa]
